# Pourover Coffee Calculator
This project is a pourover coffee calculator that gives a coffee bean to water ratio, depending on desired taste of bold, medium, or light coffee preference.

To do:
- (done) add 3 buttons for choices in HTML file
- decide on switch or if/else to store bold, med, light logic
- onclick events: run bold, med, light algorithms
- lastly, style

Future ideas:
- pourover coffee tools info (Hario v60, Chemex, etc)
- Use slider instead of 3 buttons for more flavor preference choices
