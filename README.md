# Pourover Coffee Calculator
This project is a pourover coffee calculator that gives a coffee bean to water ratio, depending on desired taste of bold, medium, or light coffee preference.

4/6/23:
- Changed buttons to dropdown
- Used constant for bold, med, weak for simplicity

To do:
- (done) add 3 buttons for choices in HTML file
- (done) decide on switch or if/else to store bold, med, light logic
- (done) onclick events: run bold, med, light algorithms
- (done) style

Future potential ideas:
- Pourover coffee tools info (Hario v60, Chemex, etc)
- Test slider instead of dropdown for more visual appeal for flavor preference choices
